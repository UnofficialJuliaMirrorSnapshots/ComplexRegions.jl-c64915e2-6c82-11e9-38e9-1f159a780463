	Complex(::AbstractCurve) 
Interpret a curve as having points of type Complex.

Interpret a curve as having points of type Polar.

Interpret a curve as having points of type Spherical.
""" Spherical(::AbstractCurve)

	winding(P,z)
Compute the winding number of a closed curve or path `P` about the point `z`. Each counterclockwise rotation about `z` contributes +1, and each clockwise rotation about it counts -1. The winding number is zero for points not in the region enclosed by `P`. 

The result is unreliable for points lying on `P`, for which the problem is ill-posed.

	X + z
	z + X 
Translate a curve, path, or region `X` by a complex number `z`.

	-X 
Negate a curve, path, or region `X` (reflect through the origin).

Translate a curve, path, or region `X` by a number `-z`.

	X*z 
Multiply the curve, path, or region `X` by complex number `z`; i.e., scale and rotate it about the origin.

Multiply the curve, path, or region `X` by the number `1/z`; i.e., scale and rotate it about the origin.

Invert the curve, path, or region `X` pointwise and multiply by the number `z`.

Detect whether `z` lies inside the closed curve or path `X`. For a bounded path, this always means the bounded region enclosed by the curve, regardless of orientation; for an unbounded path, it means the region "to the left" as one walks along the path.

Detect whether `z` lies outside the closed curve or path `X`. For a bounded path, this always means the unbounded region complementary to the enclosure of the curve, regardless of orientation; for an unbounded path, it means the region "to the right" as one walks along the path.
